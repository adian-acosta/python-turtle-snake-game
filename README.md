This project is part of a large set of projects I am making within this month (4/18/2025 at the time of editing) so I may practice more in Python with the main focus on this project being in object oriented programming and class inheritance.

## How to Play

- use the **arror keys** to move the snake, if you rather use different keys within the main.py file edit the call to the turtle onkey method to the desired keys.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- No external libaries needed as this uses the built-in turtle module.

## Setup and Run

- Within the terminal move into the desired location to have this project stored and clone this repository and move into the folder with the commands
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adian-acosta/python-turtle-snake-game.git
cd python-turtle-snake-game
```
- Once setup run this command in the terminal and a window will pop up with the game.
```bash
python main.py
```
